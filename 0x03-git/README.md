# 0x01. Git
My first repository of my first ALX project! In this project, completed on my zero-day at ALX, I was introduced to Git and GitHub; specifically, I started practicing creating repositories, commiting, pushing code, createing and merging branches, pulling updates, and working as a collaborator.

## Contents
